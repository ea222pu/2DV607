# Second

I recently uploaded my version of the 'Hello World' application using React. It has two ways of greeting the user:

1. The user types something and press 'enter'. The greeting is changed to "Hello something!"
2. The greeting updates whenever the user types a character.

I think both of these methods help to demonstrate (at least for me as a beginner) the virtual DOM, and also I took this opportunity to try and render multiple components.

It is available for testing [here](http://ea222pu.github.io/2DV607/HelloWorld/).
