# Entry 3

I'm currently working on a quiz game as my project. My goal is to have several categories to choose from, or if the user wants to mix the categories. If possible, I would like users to be able to submit questions, and also, if possible, create custom quiz games.

As of now, there is some code that aren't used. I will make it cleaner, but right now I don't want to remove it as I am using it to test different approaches to this project.

Some problems I have at the moment:
* When I install some modules (e.g react-router) globally (-g), they can't be used. Don't know why. Speant many hours trying to figure it out...
* For the quiz, I don't know if the logic of the game should be done in quiz.js, or in a reducer.

That's it for now.
