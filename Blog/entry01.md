# First!

### About me
Hello!
My name is Emil Axelsson, I'm 25 years old and studying Software Technology at Linnaeus University, Växjö.

### JavaScript experience
I don't have a lot of experience developing web applications, apart from a course in PHP and trying out [Phaser](http://phaser.io) for games, however last semester I was tasked to develop a mobile application using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com), where I did alot of JavaScript developing.

### Environment
I mostly use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) with some extensions and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
